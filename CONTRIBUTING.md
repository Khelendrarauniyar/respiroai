2. **Clone your fork**: `git clone https://github.com/Khelendrarauniyar/respiroai.git`
3. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. **Make your changes**
5. **Test your changes**
6. **Commit**: `git commit -m "Add your feature"`
7. **Push**: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`

## üêõ Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Khelendrarauniyar/respiroai/issues).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## üîß Development Process

We use GitHub Flow, so all code changes happen through pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## üíª Development Setup

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install pytest black flake8 mypy

# Run tests
pytest

# Format code
black .

# Lint code
flake8 .
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install development dependencies
npm install --save-dev eslint prettier

# Run tests
npm test

# Format code
npm run format

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Backend Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Use pytest for testing
- Test coverage should be > 80%
- Include integration tests for API endpoints

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_models.py

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Frontend Testing

- Write unit tests for components
- Use Jest and React Testing Library
- Include snapshot tests for UI components
- Test user interactions and API calls

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Update snapshots
npm test -- --updateSnapshot
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- Use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting
- Add type hints where possible
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes

```python
def predict_disease(image_path: str, model_type: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Predict disease from X-ray image.
    
    Args:
        image_path: Path to the X-ray image
        model_type: Type of model ('pneumonia', 'tuberculosis', 'lung_cancer')
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing prediction results
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If model_type is not supported
        FileNotFoundError: If image_path doesn't exist
    """
    pass
```

### JavaScript/React (Frontend)

- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
- Follow React best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Write JSDoc comments for complex functions

```javascript
/**
 * Upload and analyze X-ray image
 * @param {File} imageFile - The X-ray image file
 * @param {string} diseaseType - Type of disease to detect
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Analysis results
 */
const analyzeImage = async (imageFile, diseaseType) => {
  // Implementation
};
```
